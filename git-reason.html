	<h2>Why Git?</h2>
	<p>Git is a version control system records changes carried out to a file, or a set of files over time, and helps you to recall specific versions of the code later on when you need it. It keeps track of each and every version of your code developed for a particular feature</p>
	<h4>Advantages of Git</h4>
	<hr>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Performance</b>
			<p>Git performs very strongly and reliably when compared to other version control systems. New code changes can be easily commited, version branches can be effortlessly compared and merged, and code can also be optimized to perform better. Algorithms used in developing Git take the full advantage of the deep knowledge stored within, with regards to the attributes used to create real source code file trees, how files are modified over time and what kind of file access patters are used to recall code files as and when needed by developers. Git primarily focus upon the file content itself rather than file names while determining the storage and file version history. Object formats of Git repository files use several combinations of delta encoding and compression techniques to store metadata objects and directory contents.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Security</b>
			<p>Git is designed specially to maintain the integrity of source code. File contents as well as the relationship between file and directories, tags, commits, versions etc. are secured cryptographically using an algorithm called SHA1 which protects the code and change history against accidental as well as malicious damage. You can be sure to have an authentic content history for your soruce code with Git.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Flexibility</b>
			<p>A key design objective of Git is the kind of flexibility it offers to support several kinds of nonlinear development workflows and its efficiency in handling both small scale and large scale projects as well as protocols. It is uniquely designed to support tagging and branching operations and store each and every activity carried out by the user as an integral part of "change" history. Not all VCSs support this feature.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Wide acceptance</b>
			<p>Git offers the type of performance, functionality, security and flexibility that most developers and teams need to develop their projects. When compared to other VCS Git is most widely accepted system owing to its universally accepted usability and performance standards.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Quality open source project</b>
			<p>Git is a widely supported open source project with over ten years of operational history. People maintaining the project are very well matured and possess a long term vision to meet the long term needs of users by releasing staged upgrades at regular intervals of time to improve functionality as well as usability. Quality of open source software made available on Git is heavily scrutinized a countless number of times and businesses today depend heavily on Git code quality.</p>
